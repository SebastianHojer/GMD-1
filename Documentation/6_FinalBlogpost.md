## Finishing touches
- I added a Mainmenu, a credits scene and a settings screen
- Added an AudioManager
- Added Music and sound effects for coin pickup and buying items
- Added a Game Over screen, that can restart the game or take the player to the main menu
- Finished the round mechanics

## Conclusion
I have learned a lot from trying to make my first game. This is what I accomplished with my game:
- A game that works, and that has some finished gameplay mechanics.
- Creating some UI that works, and that can be easily navigated: Shop, Settings page, Credits and Main Menu. It is also navigable by controller.
- A main menu that works, with a settings page where the sound volume can be set.

## Gameplay Loop
This is the gameplay loop that I ended up with:
1. Start the game, in which you enter the main menu. Press Play.
2. Able to move around the town and explore the surroundings.
3. Able to interact with the shop in the town.
4. Able to take the portal to the battlefield, where enemies can be fought
5. Fight with enemies to earn gold and healing items.
6. After 60 seconds, the remaining enemies must be eliminated.
7. Then the player is returned to the town, where he can purchase items if he wants
8. Able to go back to the battlefield, and keep the loop going.
9. Enemies get harder and harder for each round.

That is the gameplay loop that I ended up with. I am pretty happy with this, but I did have a lot of ideas that I didn't get to implement. \

## What would I have liked to implement?
Reading back on the GDD, there were some things that I didn't have time to implement, such as:
- A more advanced weapons system, where the weapons could be switched between
- More different pickups from enemies, such as throwables and other stuff
- More types of weapons, bows, staffs and so on.
- I also wanted to make a boss fight, which I didn't have the time to make.
- The style I went for in the GDD isn't exactly what I ended up with, instead I took more of a Medieval approach 

## Working in Unity
Working in Unity was pretty enjoyable for the most part. It is pretty easy to understand and get started, and Unity does a lot of things for you, that you don't have to do on your own. \
I worked with the UI system, and got some pretty good, working, UI that I was pretty happy with. \
The hardest part of making the game was thinking in a "game mindset", and I am not very used to this. As such, the hardest part didn't have anything to do with Unity, and working in Unity was an overall good experience.

## Final Conclusion
Considering that I worked alone on the game, I am actually pretty happy with the result. There is still a lot of things I would've liked to implement, but time didn't permit that. \ 
I have learned a lot about game development and the whole process, and I also found out, during the process, that there is a lot more to it than I first thought. Maybe that is also why I was a bit overly ambitious in the GDD, before I actually started making the game.

## BanditSlayer
My game, BanditSlayer, is a 2D side-scrolling wave-beating game, where you have to defend your town by beating waves of bandits in a battlefield.  
The games target audience will probably be young people between the ages 17-25, as the game might contain gore and violence. The heavy use of weapons and violence will probably appeal more to the male audience. The ESRB-rating would be Mature. It could be rated Teen depending on how much gore and blood the final game will contain. 
In the game, the protagonist, Bard, finds out that bandits plan on invading his town of ... He must learn to save his town by using different weapons to defeat enemies. The game should make the player feel a drive towards slaying enemies to save their town, and this is also what should keep the player engaged. The game will also include a weapons system, with different unlockable weapons, which might also encourage players to play the game. Furthermore, there will be some boss fights or similar, where the player must beat a bigger, harder enemy. The game will also include quests which are offered by NPCs and which will give the player some reward (gold, special weapon, consumables etc.). This will make the game more varied and will give the player some more objectives to work on. 
The player chooses when to go on the battlefield. Usually the battlefield will just include one wave, but after defeating a wave, the player can decide whether to go home with the rewards, or push their luck for more rewards but harder enemies. 
The in-game GUI will contain a statically positioned health bar for the player and monsters will have health bars over their character. The GUI will also contain some icon of the weapon the player is wielding as well as other weapons if the player has multiple. 
The weapons system will consist of a few different weapons that the player can unlock through the game. The weapons can be bought in-between rounds where the player can roam the town and go into different shops. Throwables might also be added to the game, such as hand grenades or similar.
The visual style of the game will be foresty, pixel-art and a bit dark/gloomy. This should support the players experience by feeling nostalgia towards older games and the darkness will make the game feel more intense. I include a visual below to show the visual style that the game will try to achieve. The game will also include background music, which will be mysterious and dark, and game sound effects both from enemies and from interacting with the world.

The game-world will mostly be the town where the player lives. The player will meet different NPCs and signs in the town, and there will also be some NPCs that can sell items to the player. The game is split between intense rounds where the player is fighting off hordes of bandits, and relaxing between-rounds where the player can walk around the town and buy stuff. 
The game will be monetized through the sale of the game itself. It will not include micro-transactions or in-game purchases. This is justified as the game itself is complete and contains a full experience. 
The controls of the game will include a joystick for walking left and right, a button for jumping, a button for shooting, a button for interacting and a button for switching weapons. 
I will here identify some milestones for the development of the game: 
### Milestone 1: 
Basic movement, physics, first level, assets. Add collectables and collisions with these. Add a gold system and a balance to keep track of how much gold the player has. I will make the battlefield first where you fight enemies, to start it will just be a flat field, and I will start working on the town. 
### Milestone 2: 
Implementation of most of the town, at least one shop. Implement the weapons system and buying weapons from a vendor. Maybe make the battlefield a bit more varied. Add an enemy that can be killed and that drops collectables. 
### Milestone 3: 
Add and implement enemies and AI, health, damage, and health bars. Implement the quest system and add a final boss level or similar.

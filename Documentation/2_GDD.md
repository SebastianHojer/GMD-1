## Lost World
My game, Lost World, is a 2D run-and-gun platformer game in the adventure genre. The game will contain some elements of puzzle games as well. 
The games target audience will probably be young people between the ages 17-25, as the game might contain gore and violence. The heavy use of weapons and violence will probably appeal more to the male audience. The ESRB-rating would be Mature. It could be rated Teen depending on how much gore and blood the final game will contain. 
In the game, the protagonist, Bard, wakes up in a new realm that he has never seen before. He must learn to navigate this realm and use different weapons to defeat enemies. The game grants the player a fantasy of exploring the unknown in this new, different realm. The game should make the player feel a drive towards exploring the unknown, and this is also what should keep the player engaged. The game will also include a weapons system, with different unlockable weapons, which might also encourage players to play the game. Furthermore, there will be some boss fights or similar, where the player must beat a bigger, harder enemy.
The in-game GUI will contain a statically positioned health bar for the player and monsters will have health bars over their character. The GUI will also contain some icon of the weapon the player is wielding as well as other weapons if the player has multiple. For parts of the game where the player can hold some item, there will also be an icon for the item.
The weapons system will consist of a few different weapons that the player can unlock through the game. Some weapons have a purpose, like progressing through a level, while other weapons will simply be for damaging enemies. Throwables might also be added to the game, such as hand grenades or similar.
The visual style of the game will be old-school, dark and low-res. This should support the players experience by feeling nostalgia towards older games and the darkness will enhance the adventure part of the game. I include a visual below to show the visual style that the game will try to achieve. The game will also include background music, which will be mysterious and dark, and game sound effects both from enemies and from interacting with the world.

The game-world will be an underground secret society. The player will meet different NPCs and signs through the game which will introduce the player to this secret society and explain why they live underground. The people who live underground were once normal people but were expelled to the underground because they were different. Some levels will include monsters which the player can fight, while other levels are 'safe places' such as towns where the only objective is to talk to NPC's or read signs to better understand the story.
The game will be monetized through the sale of the game itself. It will not include micro-transactions or in-game purchases. This is justified as the game itself is complete and contains a full experience.
The controls of the game will include a joystick for walking left and right, a button for jumping, a button for shooting, a button for interacting and a button for switching weapons.
I will here identify some milestones for the development of the game:
Milestone 1: Basic movement, physics, first level, platforms, assets. Add collectables and collisions with these. Add game info for the player, maybe as interactable signs or dialogue.
Milestone 2: Implementation of shooting and the weapons system. Make some more levels.
Milestone 3: Add and implement enemies and AI, health, damage, and health bars. Add a final boss level or similar.
